# GoDB

This repo implements a simple database in GO, which is a part of the course [[MIT] 6.5830/6.5831: Database Systems](https://dsg.csail.mit.edu/6.5830/).
The main goal is to understand how databases work, and to implement a simple database from scratch.

## Lab Notes

Here are my notes for the labs in this course, which describe what I have done in each lab.

1. **Lab 1**: 
   - Implement heap files as an asset method for storing data. This arranges data into a set of pages, each of which contains a fixed number of tuples (rows).
   - Using buffer pool for caching pages in memory, which allows for efficient access to the data.
2. **Lab 2**:
3. **Lab 3**:

## More Features

I plan to implement more features in the future to enhance the database functionality.
